# Library App

Library app built using HTML, CSS, and JS. Users can add new books with the information of the book to be displayed as cards. Information that can be added are book title, author title, number of pages, and the status of whether the book is read or unread. Local storage is used to save the book cards on page refresh. The ability to remove the book card is available. Form validation is used to ensure users input the required fields. Users are able to toggle the read status button to be read or unread. 

## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS
- JS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to setup a book class which is used to create the multiple book cards through instantiation. I learned how to save the data of the book cards into local storage so that if the user refreshes the page they do not lose their data. This project also served as practice to reinforce DOM manipulation and CSS styling.
